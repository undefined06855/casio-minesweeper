# Mini Minesweeper

Minesweeper for the CASIO FX-CG50/Prizm (and similar calculators - if it can take a .g3a it can probably run it!)

## Installation

Take the .g3a file from the releases panel on the right (if I remember to upload it)

## Compilation

See [the PrizmSDK setup guide](https://prizm.cemetech.net/Tutorials/PrizmSDK_Setup_Guide/), then clone this repo into the `projects` folder, and run the `make.bat`

For VSCode, I would recommend adding a `.vscode/settings.json` file



god i hate this 5 year old half-broken sdk (calling sys_calloc crashes??) with no support apart from ancient forum threads!
